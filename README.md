# Penetration Testing Tools

On this repository, you will find a list of tools, classified by use. 

# OSINT

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a multi-factor (qualitative, quantitative) methodology for collecting, analyzing and making decisions about data accessible in publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. In the intelligence community, the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources). OSINT under one name or another has been around for hundreds of years. With the advent of instant communications and rapid information transfer, a great deal of actionable and predictive intelligence can now be obtained from public, unclassified sources. It is not related to open-source software or collective intelligence.

# Web

Web applications play a vital role in every modern organization. But, if your organization does not properly test and secure its web apps, adversaries can compromise these applications, damage business functionality, and steal data. Unfortunately, many organizations operate under the mistaken impression that a web application security scanner will reliably discover flaws in their systems.

# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses and flaws in systems and software running on them. This is an integral component of a vulnerability management program, which has one overarching goal – to protect the organization from breaches and the exposure of sensitive data. These programs rely on assessment to gauge security readiness and minimize risk, and vulnerability scanning is a critical tool in the cybersecurity toolbox.

There are two big challenges related to traditional vulnerability assessment – knowing what to scan and knowing when to scan:

-   Keeping an up-to-date asset inventory is an essential first step and requires its own set of tools and strategies.
-   Making sure that your vulnerability scanning tools cover non-traditional assets such as BYOD devices, IoTs, mobile assets, and cloud services is essential.
-   In a world where cyber threats can come from any direction and at any time, the ability to configure and perform continuous monitoring and scanning (as opposed to monthly or     quarterly vulnerability scans) is key.

# Exploitation

During Exploitation phase, the penetration testers try to actively exploit security weaknesses. Exploits are developed to, for example, gather sensitive information or to enable the pentesters to compromise a system and manifest themselves on it. Once a system is successfully compromised, it is quite often possible to penetrate more systems, because the pentesters now have access to more potential targets that were not available before, for example because the compromised system is be able to interact with internal systems that are not accessible from the Internet. For any new targets, the reconnaissance and enumeration phases are re-entered, to gather information about these new systems and exploit them, too.

# Persistence

So if you manage to compromise a system you need to make sure that you do not lose the shell. If you have used an exploit that messes with the machine the user might want to reboot, and if the user reboots you will lose your shell.

Or, maybe the way to compromise the machine is really complicated or noisy and you don't want to go through the hassle of doing it all again. So instead you just create a backdoor that you can enter fast and easy.

# Pivoting

Pivoting is the unique technique of using an instance (also referred to as a ‘plant’ or ‘foothold’) to be able to move around inside a network. Basically using the first compromise to allow and even aid in the compromise of other otherwise inaccessible systems. In this scenario we will be using it for routing traffic from a normally non-routable network.

For example, we are a pentester for Security-R-Us. You pull the company directory and decide to target a user in the target IT department. You call up the user and claim you are from a vendor and would like them to visit your website in order to download a security patch. At the URL you are pointing them to, you are running an Internet Explorer exploit.

# Reporting

Penetration test reports are very important and provide you with the structured detailed of the pentest after the engagement has completed. However oftentimes this critical documentation lacks key aspects of what should be included, and clients begin to question the practical value of their assessments—and rightfully so. The report is everything.
